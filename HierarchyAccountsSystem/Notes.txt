I. Database schema design

  In order to achieve the required hierarhical structure there were several possible approaches:
    - Adjacent table 
    - Materialized path (that includes SQL Server built-in HierarhyId routines)
    - Closure table

  It is decided to go in materialized path approach due to that we have simple requirement and dont expect huge load over the api.
  As well as Materialized path approach gives possibility to enforce restriction and protection on database level as well and not only in-code.

  TABLE STRUCTURE ([dbo].[Accounts]):
	  [AccountID] [int] NOT NULL, PK Its the uniqie account identifier holding sequental values
	  [Name] [nvarchar](200) NOT NULL, The name of the account
	  [ParentAccountID] [int] NULL, Parent account unique ID (if NULL then this is master root)
	  [AccountNodePath] [nvarchar](400) NOT NULL, Materialized path generated for each tree node in format / (master root), /1/, /1/2/

  CONSTRAINTS:
    - CK_AccountNodes_MaxDepth - used to enforce max depth limitation to 5
    - CK_AccountNodes_RootPath - used to enforce correct format for master root node materialized path

  TRIGGERS:
    - TR_Accounts_OneRoot - used to enforce guarding on eventual attempt to create second master root node in the tree (in case the application code detection fails)
    - TR_Accounts_PreventCycles - used to enforce guarding of eventual cyclec that can happen on adding or moving nodes in the tree


II. API design
  - The API is designed in RESTful manner following best practices.
  - Versioning is implemented via URL segmenting (v1).
  - Endpoints are grouped by resources (account).
  - Standard HTTP methods are used (GET, POST, PUT).
  - Responses include appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

III. Migrations and database creation
  - Entity Framework Core is used for database access and migrations.
  - On application startup, pending migrations are applied automatically to ensure the database schema is up-to-date.
  - Initial seeding of the master root account is performed if it does not exist.

IV. Console application
  - A simple console application is provided with basic functionality to only print the tree of specified account or if account not specified print the whole tree.
  - It includes custom basic ApiClient class to interact with the API endpoints.
  - The console application accepts command-line arguments for account ID.
